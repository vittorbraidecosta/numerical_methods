# About the repo 

*Created on 2022.1* | This repo contains three different codes to solve numerical methods proposed by the module 'Numerical Methods and Applications' at the University of São Paulo. Each code has a PDF report of all processes developed. As it was developed to a lecture in São Paulo, it is written in Portuguese. 

## EP1 - Code 1

The first code was implemented to apply LU decomposition in a matrix A. This was done to simplify calculations while solving a system of linear equations, for example. 

## EP2 - Code 2

This code was implemented to solve integration problems with a numerical approach. To do so Gauss Formulation was used.

## EP3 - Code 3

In an attempt to integrate all methods learned in class and the two codes produced before, EP3 was created to perform a Finite Elements Method to find the temperature distribution in a heated computer microchip. 

The image below shows one of the results obtained for heating concentrated in the middle of the microchip.
